A simple internal star rating for your collections or reviews.  

== Description ==

A simple internal star rating plugin for your personal collection or reviews.  For example, if you are cataloging your book collection with WordPress you will add a number between 1-5 to the My Rating Field and that rating will appear as ratings with stars on the front end.  There a number ratings plugins that allow users to vote on the content but I wanted something simpler for my own collection.  

This could be used for reviews and was as personal collections of books, movies, videogames, etc ...



== Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. On the edit post screen, enter a number between .5-5 in the My Rating field. Half stars will work - for example, if you use 4.5.
1. Add the shortcode [star] to you post where you would like the star rating to appear or use the shortcode button on the toolbar.
